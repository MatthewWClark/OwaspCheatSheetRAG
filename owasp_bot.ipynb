Question: Can you provide an example of how XSS can be used to steal data from a website? Answer: The following example shows how XSS can be used to steal user credentials from a web application. User A logs in to a popular web application and enters their username and password. During the login process, the web application sends a JavaScript script that injects an XSS vulnerability. This allows an attacker to steal the username and password of another user who also entered that same username and password during the same session. In this example, User B's username is stored in a cookie that the web application sends back to the server along with their login request. The XSS script then uses the cookie value to steal both the username and the password from User A's session on the web application.</s>\"}"
